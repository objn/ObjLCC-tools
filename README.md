## Installation
No need install on your device. I trying to work everything on cloud machine <br />
Optional: If you want to work on Docker It work! but you need to change path in my code. <br />
<br />

## Model
| Model  | Version | Result | Comment |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Objn001  | alpha | Very bad | Need more training |
| Objn002  | alpha | Bad | Need more Dataset |
| Objn003 | Release | Very Good | It perfect for detect Lunar crater | <br />

## Plan of Project
Before I get into the details, let me talk about the order of use. <br />
Go to Colab -> Prepare environment -> Split Map lunar (LROC) -> Prediction -> Reassemble Map & Label -> Convert To SCC or SHP <br />
(à¸ºBase on Qgis)

| Section | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Document Manual | Working in process |
| Prepare environment | Ready to use |
| Pizza Cutter Map | I need be sorted agian but ready to use |
| Landing Zone | I need be sorted agian but ready to use |
| Prediction | Ready to use |
| Convert To SCC or SHP | Working in process |

## Usage

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pU76VY2_q49yPOio20xvltPwC46dPvp1 <br />
1.Run all cell in Prepare environment <br />

Optional: If you want to use model yolov8. You will need GPU: RTX, T4, A100 or something it could run CUDA :D 

### Pizza Cuter Map
1.Download TIF MAP
2.Convert TIP TO PNG
3.Split large image to 1280x1280 and resize to 640x640 for put in to Yolov8 model
4.Ready to Prediction or Training

### Landing Zone
It is like a file manager that can be used to connect to Google Drive or other devices
